\usage{
merge_data(synoptic_df, ghcnd_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{synoptic_df}{data.frame; observations from Synoptic Data PBC, as
outputted by weatherAndClimateUitls::load_data_synoptic()}

\item{ghcnd_df}{data.frame; observations from GHCNdm, as outputted by
weatherAndClimatePlots::clean_raw_ghcnd_to_standard()}
}
\value{
a data.frame() with GHCNd observations augmented with observations
from Synoptic. Any observations which exist in GHCNd take precidence, because
their maxima and minima are more trustworthy (since they are not as dependent)
on the temporal resolution of the full hi-res data as the synoptic obs, which
are sometimes hourly.
